## Abstract
There has long been a demand for translating Carpentry lessons into other languages. In March 2018, we published the first two Software Carpentry lessons in Spanish! We are very happy that volunteers from 11 different countries contributed to help make this dream a reality. In this lightning talk, we will discuss 1) how we are translating the lessons, 2) how we are maintaining and improving lessons, 3) how we are supporting the Spanish-speaking community within The Carpentries. We hope that this talk will help others better understand the challenges and opportunities for developing Carpentry lessons in other languages.
