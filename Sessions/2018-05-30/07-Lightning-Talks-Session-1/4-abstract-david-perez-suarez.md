## Abstract
An incredible effort has been done in the last year to translate a few lessons, with the first one being officially launched last March. However, this has been done without using tools that help translators. I propose a model that will help to monitor what has been translated and where help is needed using GitHub, Travis and common translation tools used in other open source communities.
