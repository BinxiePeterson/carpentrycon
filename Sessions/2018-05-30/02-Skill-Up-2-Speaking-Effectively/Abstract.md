## Abstract
Speaking well is a fantastic skill to have in any career. Yet many people are frightened of public speaking, and are not sure this is a skill they can master. The good news is great speakers, like great teachers, are not born, but made, using the practice/feedback/practice loop that is so effective in instructor training.

In this session, I will cover tips and techniques for speaking well. I will give you at least five **DON'T!** s as well. 

I will talk about some of the unconscious thinking that can sabotage even our best efforts.

This will be a collaborative session - the floor will be open so we can all share good ideas.
