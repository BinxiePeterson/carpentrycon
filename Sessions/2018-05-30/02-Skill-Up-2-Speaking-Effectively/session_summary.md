## Speaking effectively by Belinda Weaver

*I used a lot of pictures on my slides so they won't be helpful. Here  instead is a rough guide to what I said.*

More than 23% of Australians fear public speaking more than death ! 

Yet public speaking is not terrifying – eventually. Like any skill, it has to be practised before it can be mastered. 
No-one is an expert speaker right off the bat. No-one is a natural. But anyone can learn to speak well as long as you 
are prepared to *practise, practise, practise*. I used to feel absolute panic about speaking publicly - **REAL PANIC!** Then one
day I attended a political meeting and got so angry I got up and said something. That broke the ice and I realised I could do it.
Now I have had a LOT of practice and that has got me comfortable speaking anywhere to anyone.

Part of what frightens people are (unconscious) fears and mental messages that catastrophise what will happen if they get up and 
do a talk. It is good to examine what those catastrophising thoughts are and to put them to rest. The world won’t explode 
if you don’t present well. People will soon forget it if your talk is less than stellar. 
No-one will mind as much as you nor be as critical as you so try to put the disaster thoughts away. 

Are they helping? No. 

The first time getting up to speak can be tough but it gets easier and easier with practice – just like driving or 
teaching or diving from a high board.

Here are some don’ts. 

1) Don’t try to be perfect. 

A lot of people strive for perfection and put a lot of pressure on themselves for this very reason. Perfection is not desirable! It is important to try to be good enough, but if you are obsessing about getting everything perfectly right, you will come across as anxious and uptight instead of relaxed, and this is anxiety-producing for your listeners. Try to SEEM relaxed even if you don’t feel it. If things go wrong, take it in your stride and don’t stress about it. Have a laugh! I do. Perfection is rather an icy and cold divinity – people respond much better to people who appear human and relatable. 

2) Don’t apologise for or undercut yourself. 

It actually makes me groan inside when someone gets up and says: “I’ve never spoken in public before – this will probably be terrible” – by then I am agreeing with them!
Let the audience be the ones to think it is terrible if they are going to but please don’t encourage them to do so! Start confidently. You have the stage – use it!

3) Don’t put up a ton of words on your slides and then read those words to people. 

THAT IS MADDENING. We can all read faster than you can say the words and we don’t want to have to wait for you to stumble through reading them back to us. Have only a few key points on slides or – better still – use pictures to illustrate what you will say. Try to avoid SOME WORDS – the repetition of nervous filler words such as “Um, ahh, like, you know, um, ahh” will not be good. Try to eliminate those from your repertoire. 

If you have to keep to a strict time, you might want to try writing your speech out beforehand and then reading it. 
If so, speak it on to the page (i.e. say a sentence and write it down the way you said it – as speech). Anything you 
write without speaking it first will come across as stilted when you read it out. It takes a lot of practice to write a 
speech that sounds like speech rather than something academic – speeches must seem natural when delivered. Don’t RUSH – 
that will always make you seem nervous. 

4) Don’t avoid eye contact with your audience.

One reason I don’t like a lot of words on slides is that it encourages speakers to look at the screen and thus turn their backs on their listeners. This is BAD. Look around the room constantly, make eye contact with people, as this will help them focus on you and help you get your message across. If someone is looking bored or fiddling with their phone, don’t look at that person again – find the alert, interested-looking people in the crowd and focus on them. This can actually be energising and confidence-boosting – especially if people are nodding and agreeing with what you say. 

5) Stick to your plan and don’t get tempted to go off on tangents. 

You will more than likely get lost and it can be hard to pick up the thread again. Tangents and side issues can come up in the discussion or question section. 

### Before

You are going to find it easier to get your message across if you can tell it as a story. What is your story? What personal 
stuff will you share? Stories make us relatable.

Also you need to rehearse! No actor or musician goes on stage without a lot of rehearsal. You need to have delivered your 
talk two or three times – to a mirror, to your dog, to a friend or colleague, or even to no-one - to get comfortable with 
the words, the flow, the way it will all sound and hang together. It needs to be familiar! If rehearsing makes you nervous, 
think how much worse your nerves will be when you get up to speak for real without any real confidence that you know how to 
get your message across. Practising and getting it down pat – eliminating the ‘gotchas’ or the tangled phrases where you get lost – 
will calm your nerves on the day. Make sure you can read your notes. Don’t have too many – just the key points. 

### On the day

* Be there early. Nothing is worse than being late and feeling rushed. Scope out the room and its location so you can be present and 
breathing calmly before you have to go on. (You can’t breathe deeply AND be anxious at the same time. 
If you find yourself hyperventilating, slow down your breath.) 
* If you are using a laptop, make sure you have everything you need – power cable, adapters for the projector, and so on. 
Have you got your glasses if you need them for reading?
No-one wants to watch you stumble through technical glitches. Check out the microphone if there is one and use it. 
It saves your voice and keeps you audible if you adrenaline goes low. 
* Drink water the night before, and before and during your talk. Voices need a LOT of hydration, but pausing to sip will 
also allow you to take a calm breather during your talk. Don’t clear your throat - this is damaging. If you feel the urge 
to clear your throat, swallow instead.
* When you are introduced, SMILE at your audience. This is an easy way to get them on your side.  

I have a rule of three when talking :

1.	Tell them what you are going to tell them
2.	Then tell them
3.	Then tell them what you told them

The rule of three allows me to **SIGNPOST** what is coming up. It helps alert people to what is about to be said, 
so they are ready for the message when it comes. Recapping the message at the end of the point reinforces it.

I always use a lot of signposting, e.g. “I am going to cover three main points. My first point …  My second point ..” 
This helps people focus on the topic.

Architect Mies van der Rohe is famous for saying “Less is More”. In talks this is usually right. 
Most people go on too long, or provide too much detail. Be short, crisp and succinct. Leave your audience 
keen to hear more rather than overwhelmed with word and information. 

When you are finished, **STOP!** A lot of people don’t know how to stop talking. They keep going until they are interrupted. I always stop with a final “Thank you” or “That’s all I have” so people know I have finished.

Then I might ask *“What questions do you have for me?”*
