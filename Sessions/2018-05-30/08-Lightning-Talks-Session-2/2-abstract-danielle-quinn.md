## Abstract
Field School is a Miami-based organization that provides students with educational experiences to connect with the natural world and embrace scientific enquiry. Operating from a 55’ live-aboard research vessel, and offering courses ranging from highly specialized training skills (Shark and Ray Handling) to once-in-a-lifetime experiences (Sperm Whale Research Expedition), they provide opportunities for students to acquire a wide range of skills. As computational skills become increasingly integral to research, students with limited coding experience face the daunting task of learning programming and statistics simultaneously. The Carpentries pedagogical model was used to design a three-day immersive Introduction to Ecological Modelling in R workshop. Learners rotated between hands-on live-coding modules, student-led coworking sessions, and physical activities exploring the local ecosystem. I’ll share my experiences teaching the inaugural “R at Sea” aboard the RV Garvin and what I learned about mixing feedback with free diving, live-coding with coral reefs, and modelling with mangroves.
