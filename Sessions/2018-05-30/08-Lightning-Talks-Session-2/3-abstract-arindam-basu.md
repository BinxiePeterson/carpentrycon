## Abstract
The goal of this paper is to present evidence that the pedagogical principles of software carpentry, or the model of software carpentry style teaching can go beyond intense two-day workshops to teach computational thinking and can be used for university semester long classes in workshop format as software carpentry utilises elements of good teaching: flipped instructions, faded examples, repeated feedbacks, and hands-on work. The presenter converted a post-graduate research methods course using principles of software carpentry where students worked with the lecturer on solving problems, with faded examples, and repeated feedbacks. Computational thinking on health research methods was taught. In their informal feedback, the students reported that they learned better in this format of class compared with other formats and scored higher in the assignments. These results suggest that principles of software carpentry can provide models for teaching postgraduate courses in universities.
