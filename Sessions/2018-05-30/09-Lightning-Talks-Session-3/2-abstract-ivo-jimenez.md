## Abstract
Popper^12^ is an NSF- and CROSS-sponsored^34^ convention and CLI tool for conducting experiments and writing academic articles following best software engineering and DevOps practices. Popper organizes artifacts associated to scientific explorations inside a code repository such as Git. These "popperized" repositories^5^ are self-contained and easily shareable so that others can replicate and extend existing work. We have a draft Carpentry-formatted lesson on Popper^6^ that we want to eventually propose to be included in the official software carpentry curriculum. We are also working closely with computational/data scientists of the Exascale Project^7^ in the context of the 2018 BSSw fellowship^89^. In this talk and poster, we will introduce Popper, show a demo of the CLI tool and briefly walk through our draft version of the Carpentry-formatted lesson.
