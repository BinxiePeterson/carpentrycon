## Abstract
Popper<sup>12</sup> is an NSF- and CROSS-sponsored<sup>34</sup> convention and CLI tool for conducting experiments and writing academic articles following best software engineering and DevOps practices. Popper organizes artifacts associated to scientific explorations inside a code repository such as Git. These "popperized" repositories<sup>5</sup> are self-contained and easily shareable so that others can replicate and extend existing work. We have a draft Carpentry-formatted lesson on Popper<sup>6</sup> that we want to eventually propose to be included in the official software carpentry curriculum. We are also working closely with computational/data scientists of the Exascale Project<sup>7</sup> in the context of the 2018 BSSw fellowship<sup>89</sup>. In this talk and poster, we will introduce Popper, show a demo of the CLI tool and briefly walk through our draft version of the Carpentry-formatted lesson.
