## Abstract
Reliance of research on software led to the creation of the UK Software Sustainability Institute in 2010. In March 2012, the Institute helped spark the Research Software Engineer (RSE) movement to campaign for recognised career paths of people in academia who combine software engineering skills with an intricate understanding of research. In late 2012, the first Research Software Group (RSG) was formed at UCL, in early 2014 the UK RSE Association was launched to represent the community, and in 2016 the first RSE conference was held. In 2017-2018 the expansion to other countries started. There is increasing synergy between the RSE and training communities, with 65% of surveyed RSEs being involved in training researchers. The RSE community are involved in various types of teaching, including Carpentry-style workshops, local software community seminars, specialised training sessions for domains or more advanced topics. Often Carpentry partnerships and local training communities are formed around RSGs, which are more likely to find support and resources to contribute to training efforts. With the improved RSE career structure, we are creating better support for training goals too. The RSE community, which was previously hidden from mainstream training, has now significantly increased access to skills for researchers and is at the heart of scaling up their training provision.
