## Abstract
The University of Florida has a deep history with The Carpentries, beginning with being part of the first Data Carpentry workshop and hosting the second. Over the past two and a half years we have grown a robust Carpentries community at UF, hosting 15 workshops with over 335 attendees, including 68 new instructors. This success has been made possible by a decentralized leadership of engaged students, postdocs, and staff. This peer-led dynamic has enabled us to develop a number of unique events, including integration with other organizations and meetups, curriculum development, and alternative workshop structures (weekly episodes instead of two full days). To build upon this progress, we have recently established a formal board in the form of the UF Carpentries Club to advance our goal of providing structured pathways for learning informatics skills outside of the traditional university curriculum.
