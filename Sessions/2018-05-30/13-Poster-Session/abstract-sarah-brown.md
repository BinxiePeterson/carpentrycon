## Abstract
Jupyter notebooks' load magic pulls a code excerpt from a file into a cell for editing. Using this feature to provide exercises in a workshop reduces the burdens of syntax errors and context switching for students, allowing them to focus on the content of the problem. In truncated time tutorials, it allows learners to make it far enough in a tutorial to get to interesting content and motivates enrolling in a full length workshop. I will share my experiences preparing for and using this feature in both a full length workshop and truncated format workshop. I'll propose how lesson formats could be changed to accommodate easier adoption of this technique.
