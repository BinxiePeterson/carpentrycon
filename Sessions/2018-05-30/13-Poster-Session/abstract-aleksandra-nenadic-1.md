## Abstract
Researchers need access to software skills to empower them to write their own code, but this training is often pitched at the wrong level, not researcher-centric, or hard to access. To address this, the Software Sustainability Institute teamed up with Greg Wilson in 2012 to launch Software Carpentry in the UK. Since then, the Institute have helped train over 5000 researchers and 140 Carpentry instructors through over 160 workshops at over 40 UK institutions. Nowadays, 15 UK institutions are actively running workshops and managing their own partnerships with The Carpentries. Between 2014-2016, the Institute launched Carpentry training for life scientists through the European ELIXIR consortium, with ~280 researchers and 20 instructors from 13 EU countries trained. Library Carpentry, initiated by Institute Fellow James Baker in 2015, is now a worldwide movement. Contributors from the UK are leading curriculum development (e.g. social sciences and HPC Carpentry) and starting up new carpentries (e.g. Data Science for Doctors and computer programming for geographers).
