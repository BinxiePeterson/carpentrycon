## Abstract
The ELIXIR Training Platform is partnering with the Software and Data Carpentry Foundations (The Carpentries) to train researchers to improve their computing and data management skills. Both The Carpentries and ELIXIR are interested in supporting researchers and developers to develop better software. Hence, the “ELIXIR Software development best practices” group, which is part of the ELIXIR Tools Platform, has proposed the “Four simple recommendations to encourage best practices in research software” ^1^ (in short “4OSS”). These recommendations aim to improve quality and sustainability in research software development.
We believe that The Carpentries approach and policy to develop and maintain training materials could help us to provide clear guidelines of how to implement the 4OSS recommendations, contributing to make software FAIR. The goals of this project are to create training materials based on the four recommendations, to train developers and afterwards to implement the 4OSS as development practices.
