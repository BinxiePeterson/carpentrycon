## Abstract
The Carpentries is an organisation whose primary goal is to teach introductory concepts to best practices in handling data and basics in coding. Instructors who teach these courses are required to complete the two day curriculum of instructor training and complete three tasks as part of the checkout process. By February 2018 already more than 100 people in Africa had participated in the African instructor training workshops but significantly less than half of these participants were teaching in workshops, either because of not completing the checkout process or lack of opportunity and confidence to teach at workshops. The Carpentries African Task Force set out to remedy this in 2018 by focusing on mentoring initiatives to increase the turnover of instructor trainee to active instructor. One such initiative is the online lesson supplement which was offering six weekly 90 minute sessions to those who had participated in instructor training but were not yet teaching at Carpentry workshops. The online sessions covered a core part of the data carpentry curriculum and would allow participants the opportunity to learn some of the curriculum they had not yet been exposed to in person and/or the opportunity to be coached by those who were actively teaching on how to teach carpentry lessons in order to build confidence. The online sessions ran from 20 March 2018 to 24 April 2018 and were limited to five participants with one instructor, one assistant instructor, one admin support and one technical support person. Feedback was gathered after each session as well as a dedicated feedback session after the final lesson. We describe the approach we took to this online supplement to instructor training, how the process evolved in the face of the challenges we experienced over the course of the sessions, the feedback from participants and effect it has had on turnover to fully active African instructors. We will talk about the plans we have, based on the feedback from these sessions, for the next online instructor training supplement in 2018.
