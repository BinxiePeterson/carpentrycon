## Abstract
I am the primary author of the contributed lesson ["Programming with GAP"](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/). My poster will be based on the blog post [Programming with GAP](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/11/gap-lesson.html) and will be focused on finding a story that can develop through the whole lesson, showing how Carpentries teaching principles are incorporated in the lesson, and reporting on building the community around the lesson.
