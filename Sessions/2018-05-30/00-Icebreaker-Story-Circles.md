## Story Circle Icebreaker Activity

Many people coming to CarpentryCon 2018 will be new to our community. Coming into an event like this can be intimidating for newcomers if
you don't know anyone but everyone else seems to know lots of people. 

We want to make sure that everyone who comes to CarpentryCon 2018 meets at least a small group of people and hears their stories.
Stories provide a great way to connect. 

Because of that, we are starting CarpentryCon with an icebreaker called **Story Circles** so that no one has to feel isolated or left 
on their own in a crowd. 

[We borrowed this idea from OpenCon2017](http://www.opencon2017.org/story_of_self_circles).

Your Story Circle group can then be the 'safe' group of people to turn to during breaks or to ask and answer any questions you might have.

The format of story circles is this:

- Everyone will be assigned to a group - your group's name will be on your registration.
- Find your group - there will be designated places set aside with group names marked.
- Join your group.
- Choose a timekeeper, and decide who will go first.
- Everyone in the group then spends five completely uninterrupted minutes talking about who they are, and how they came to attend CarpentryCon.
- The others listen.
- The format is freeform - people can choose what information they are willing to share. 

The key thing is everyone has a turn, and other people in the group listen without interrupting.

We hope this format will help people feel comfortable attending CarpentryCon.
