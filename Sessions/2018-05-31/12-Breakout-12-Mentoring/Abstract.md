## Abstract
What are the characteristics of a great mentor? How can I lead small groups of instructors and other community members to achieve a common goal? During this session, we will explore strategies and resources to help potential mentors prepare to lead groups around teaching Carpentries material, hosting self-organizing workshops, and maintaining Carpentries lessons. Participants will leave equipped with the tools to mentor individuals locally, and across the Carpentriesâ€™ global community.
