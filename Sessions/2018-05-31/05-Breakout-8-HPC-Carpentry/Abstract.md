## Abstract

Many HPC sites show interest in the Software Carpentry approach to training and are keen to adopt it. In this breakout, we will firstly review what has been done with a Software Carpentry perspective in the HPC space. The main goal of the session is to gather interested people together, map out where we would like to go and define some short term targets to help us get there.
