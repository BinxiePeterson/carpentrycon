## Abstract

- Are you engaged in training activities at an HPC site or with a research community that can leverage HPC facilities?
- Are you interested in seeing the Carpentries approach to training used more in the HPC space?
- Do want to see HPC lessons developed within the Carpentries?
- Are you willing to collaborate with others to make that happen?

The Carpentries are often mentioned as providing (some of) the prerequisite knowledge to access High Performance Computing (HPC). Many HPC sites have shown interest in the Software Carpentry approach to training and are keen to adopt it's practices.

In this breakout, we will firstly review what has been done with a Software Carpentry perspective in the HPC space and the lesson material that already exists. The main goal of the session is to gather interested people together, evaluate what has been done, map out where we would like to go and define some short term targets to help us get there.

## The Plan

### **Part 1**: What has been done to date? (30 minutes)

The first part of the session will be used to review HPC Carpentry related discussions that have already taken place (primarily the [Outcomes of the HPC Carpentry BoF session at SC17](https://github.com/hpc-uk/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof/raw/master/pdf/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof-report.pdf) and the [issues of the hpc-novice lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice/issues)). In particular we will point out notable conclusions from these discussions and gather attendees feedback on them.

This will be followed by two lightning talks on
- [HPC Carpentry:
Teaching basic skills for high-performance computing.](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/)
- [HPC in a day](https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/)

### **Part 2**: Getting to `hpc-novice v1.0` (20 minutes)

Identify and address the practical challenges with *collaboratively* creating an HPC novice lesson. There are many aspects that will need to be easily tweakable:
- Access methods
- Schedulers
- Software environments
- ...

Getting this right is important as future lessons can be built upon the same infrastructure.

### **Part 3**: Beyond `hpc-novice v1.0` (10 minutes)

- Is there interest in other lessons in this space?
- How will people stay in touch?
