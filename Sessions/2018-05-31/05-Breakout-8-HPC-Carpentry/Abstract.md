## Abstract

Many HPC sites show interest in the Software Carpentry approach to training and are keen to adopt it. In this breakout, we will firstly review what has been done with a Software Carpentry perspective in the HPC space. The main goal of the session is to gather interested people together, map out where we would like to go and define some short term targets to help us get there.

## The Plan

### **Part 1**: What has been done to date? (15 minutes)

Short presentations on
- [Outcomes of the HPC Carpentry BoF session at SC17](https://github.com/hpc-uk/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof/raw/master/pdf/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof-report.pdf)
- [HPC Carpentry:
Teaching basic skills for high-performance computing.](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/)
- [HPC in a day](https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/)

### **Part 2**: Where do we go? (20 minutes, guided group discussion)

Open discussion on what short and medium goals should be, for example:
- Can we agree a scope and target group for an initial HPC novice lesson?
- How do we approach access to HPC resources, is it just assumed to be available?
- How do we make lessons flexible wrt *scheduler, environment, access,...*?
- How far could/should HPC Carpentry go?

### **Part 3**: How do we get there? (15 minutes, split in 2/3 groups)

Select 2/3 topics from the previous discussion that are suitable to be matured further by smaller groups. Refine them to help identify short-term targets and see if there are volunteers to move things forward. 

### **Part 4**: Wrap-up (10 minutes)

- Summary of split group outcomes
- What's next
