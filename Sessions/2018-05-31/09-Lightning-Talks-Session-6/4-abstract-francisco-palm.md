## Abstract
With the abrupt appearance of cryptocurrencies on the world economic scene we have begun to become more aware of the possibilities of cryptography and the importance it has for all of us at this very moment. When we make a commit in git, a hash is generated that for many people without specific training in this area of computing are only "strange characters". The same is true when researchers communicating via email wish to maintain the privacy of their work, the use of secure applications is often unnecessarily complex and convoluted. In addition, everything seems to indicate that with the possibilities of Blockchain and smart contracts, more and more, we will be requiring basic knowledge of cryptography such as hash generation and the handling of public keys. Is it time to consider the fundamentals of cryptography in the carpentries curriculum?
