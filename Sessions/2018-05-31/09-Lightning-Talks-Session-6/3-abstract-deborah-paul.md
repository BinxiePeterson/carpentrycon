## Abstract
Tools change, platforms evolve and some -- go extinct. For those mobilizing and using museum biocollections data, tools and automated processes built for familiar software platforms are not enough. As more natural science collections create digital virtual museums, those creating and using the burgeoning digital collections need data skills. A Carpentries natural history collections data lesson prototype exists. It is modeled on the Carpentries Ecology lesson and uses iDigBio specimen data. But key capabilities are missing in the translation. For example, our community needs basic georeferencing concepts, specific data transformation and evaluation skills, and an understanding of relevant data standards like Darwin Core. To increase overall lesson impact, modules need to be tailored to biocollections data tasks and data use. CarpentryCon offers the opportunity to work directly with those involved in creating and modeling new Carpentries lessons and new Carpentries communities.
