## Abstract
The CodeRefinery project, launched in 2016, is a Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) project focused on training and source code hosting for researchers in the Nordics. The main goal is to teach students and researchers how to write better code through state-of-the-art tools and practices. We address students and researchers who already write code for research and try to be as language-independent as possible in our workshops. Thus, no programming languages are taught - instead the lessons include introductory and advanced Git, documentation, automated testing, Jupyter Notebooks, CMake and software licensing. All teaching in CodeRefinery is heavily inspired by the Carpentry approach and the CodeRefinery workshops can be thought of as an intermediate/advanced continuation of Software Carpentry workshops. Indeed, we envision a closer collaboration with the Carpentries in the future.
