## Abstract
In February 2018, FOSTER Plus and TIB brought together 14 authors to write an Open Science training handbook. The practical guide written during a five-day book sprint equips future trainers with methods, instructions, exemplary training outlines and inspiration for their own trainings. The handbook provides advocates across the globe with practical know-how to deliver Open Science principles to researchers, support staff, and research administrators. It is a living resource that is online accessible under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal). The Open Science community is able to review, comment and add other contributions such as discipline-specific case studies or translations. This is how we ensure the relevance of the handbook for a broad audience.
