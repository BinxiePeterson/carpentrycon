## Abstract
Workshops and study groups are complementary approaches which both strive to address researchers' increasing need for coding/data analysis education. Where workshops bundle large amounts of information into 2-3 days of learning, study groups provide flexible, sustainable, longer-term support for learning. Study groups aim to bring together novices and more experienced coders to help each other improve their coding, data analysis, and communication skills. Such groups can rapidly adapt to the evolving needs of the community members by changing the discussed content, the meeting frequency, and even the overall format of meetings. I will discuss my own experience starting such a group tailored to biologists at my local university and provide resources for starting a study group at your own institution.
