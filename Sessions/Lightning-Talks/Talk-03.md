### Title
How I learned to stop worrying and love graph databases

### Abstract
This talk will introduce participants to graph databases. I will discuss a project where 
we graphed the hospital as a social network to prevent the spread of hospital acquired infection. 
Along the way we'll talk about modeling a graph database, loading data, and using 
graph algorithms and social network analysis to get insight out of the graph that wouldn't be possible 
in a relational database.
