### Title
Building a local bioinformatics community

### Abstract

The German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure ([de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/)) is a national network funded
by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. de.NBI provides bioinformatics services to
life-science and biomedicine researchers, constituting at the same time the German ELIXIR
node. Through one of its service centers, the Heidelberg Center for Human Bioinformatics (HDHuB),
we host a variety of bio-computational resources and offer courses and training
opportunities to scientists in a wide range of topics. Additionally, we organize events that
provide a platform to assist researchers in the Heidelberg area to network with each other and
exchange their knowledge. HD-HuB unites the bioinformatics expertise of three distinguished
research institutions: the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer
Research Center (DKFZ), and Heidelberg University, and facilitates an environment for
establishing an effective and efficient bioinformatics community in Heidelberg.

EMBL Heidelberg provides a local bioinformatics support platform, Bio-IT, to their ~600 lifescientists
across >50 groups. EMBL has reported a consistent increase in the fraction of
scientists who devote â‰¥50% of their time to computational-based research, seeing a growth
from 39% to 46% between 2009 and 2015. Bio-IT is an initiative established to support the
development and technical capability of this diverse bio-computational community. The
community has grown organically to tackle challenges together, providing training and support
for scientific computing, creating and maintaining tools and resources for reproducible science,
and providing opportunities for discussion and collaboration. 

Here, we share some lessons learned while establishing these communities and discuss the
efforts required to maintain it thereafter.
