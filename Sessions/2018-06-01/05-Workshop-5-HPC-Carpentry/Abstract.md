# Workshop 5: **HPC Carpentry**

## Lead(s)

Christina L. Koch, Peter Steinbach

## Abstract

Using the [HPC Carpentry Session](Sessions/2018-05-31/05-Breakout-8-HPC-Carpentry/Abstract.md) as a precursor, we would like to work on existing introductory material in this workshop with all attendants. At the heart of it, we would like to motivate small working groups that pick a topic of their liking from the existing open-source teaching materials and improve it.

Our vision is for the workshop is twofold: To come up with good examples to introduce pure novices to e.g. the following topics: logging in, what does a scheduler do and how to use one, making sure you know just enough bash. On the other hand, we are interested in improving or creating examples to showcase the bread-and-butter features of HPC : array jobs, MPI or even pipelines in a HTC style. 

Any of the above can involve, exercise teaching, creating pull requests. For those, that need an insight into an existing HPC Carpentry program, feel free to sign up to a HPC-in-a-day workshop just before CarpentryCon [here](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-1657.html).
