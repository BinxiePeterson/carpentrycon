## Weather and Attire

The temperature during the conference, as per the [accuweather-forecast](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ie/dublin/207931/may-weather/207931?monyr=5/1/2018&view=table), will be 8-16 Degree Celcius.

Weather in Dublin is very variable and it is not unusual to have short rain showers during the day. Unfortunately, the city is also extremely windy so umbrellas will not be very useful! A good strategy is to resort to layered clothing and to bring waterproof shoes and jackets.
