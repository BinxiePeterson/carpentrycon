## Checklist for CarpentryConnects

- GDoc Link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2kosTYdcmEcSSTzEQZy3b1wOhXJs3zJTCAWf944UO8/edit?usp=sharing)
  - **Sher**: For the Host Checklist create just a basic list of things that would definitely be required (coffee/snacks, venue accessibility, etc). Plus a list of past experiences so that we always keep the updated information.
  - **Mark**: We have a few things that are required; the core requirements would be the community-building theme and the breakout sessions. Do not constraint the imagination - put just the core concepts that should be included.


## CarpentryCon 2020

### Onboarding calls for the members of the new TF

Sher! to create a blog post on the two onboarding calls, and then send it out to the discuss list and twitter

Regarding the organization of CarpentryCon
- fund raising should start as soon as the venue is identified
- commitment is more important than the actual amount of time committed.
