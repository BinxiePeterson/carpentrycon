### Discussion points (_both calls_):

#### **Point #1**: _Keynotes_

Proposed list:
1. Kimberly Bryant (on diversity /  inclusion)
2. Anelda (on the community aspect)
3. Greg (just because :) )
4. Desmond Higgins (on Bioinformatics)

Fall-back candidates:
1. Valerie Aurora (on diversity/inclusion)
2. Jono Bacon (on community)

#### **Point #2**: _Sponsors_

No discussion. Currently handled by Tracy/Sher. All should be pushing out the call for sponsors / CarpentryCon website (http://www.carpentrycon.org/) that is already out.

#### **Point #2.1**: _Registrations_ (how much to charge and when to open)

- Current version of the charges [here](https://weaverbel.github.io/cc-draft/#information)
  - Social Events are (a) the poster session (drinks) and (b) the Social Dinner / Banquet.
- We will use Carpentries Eventbrite for managing registration process
- Include Spouse tickets for the banquet (~ 45$). Other than costs, this will also help with a head-count.
- February 15th is too early for early bird deadline. Mid March would be more convenient/practical.

_see Action Point #1_

#### **Point #3**: _Budget_

The budget, listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DkrWk0xBXr3IPzNn-8Snix13_xVqheZUYzKMyOR8A_4/edit#gid=0), was discussed in terms of how many of each "registration form" is to be expected.

#### **Point #4**: _Agenda_

Current agenda listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsIkbqxgPiM1VWvhkfyQy0wVzpKeHgj3DYp45jbaHb8/edit)

- Keep workshops on the last day of CarpentryCon. End the day with a joined event, eg. Share and Tell, Group photo, Stickies, etc.
- Every session ends up with a blog post. This can be prepared based on a Google Doc / etherpad keeping "collaborative" notes (this requiers a dedicated person per team). Can be useful for future events (could also be published after the event).
- **Lightning talks**: Not only constraint to people that want to present work, but also for people that came up an idea and want to put this out.
- Session leads will essentially play the role of the moderator as in standard conferences.

**Decision**: Keep the skeleton draft agenda (pages 5 onwards) as a pre-final version, and then have the topics poll for populating the session slots.

**Important**: We should fix the topics (most, if not all) as soon as possible, in order to open up the registrations. It should be finished within the first two weeks of February.

_see Action Point #2_

#### **Point #5**: _Specific responsibilities_

The document listing the specific responsibilities of the Conference (available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VuR-Hj2zi3MPU62_FB-JB8wWi9hSqy-ImcAiK5GaADo/edit?usp=sharing)) was discussed, and specific people were assigned to each group/subtask.

_see Action Point #3_

#### **Point #6**: _Other points_

No discussion.


### Action points:

1. Belinda will put out a draft for the letter to keynote speakers for comments. Email to be send out on **Monday, January 15th**
2. Belinda will put together a poll to the community: skill-ups (30-1h'30), breakout (1h), workshops (half-day), lightning talks (5') topics for feedback and with the question of whether you want to lead/co-lead.
3. Sher will be adding Asana tasks to all people/tasks listed in the Specific responsibilities GDoc.
