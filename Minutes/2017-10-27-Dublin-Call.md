### Discussion points:

**Dates**: May 30/5/18 - 1/6/18 (auditorium _Friday until 13:00_)

- If you can send Norman a list of our proposed requirements for the following he can investigate best fit for the event and we can then follow up with a conference call.

1. Number and size of breakout rooms required
2. Exhibitors - if any. Numbers, requirements (shell scheme build or table tops?)
3. AV requirements in each rooms
4. Posterboards - if any.


#### Rooms and Capacities

- UCD Auditorium has a capacity of ~230 (quite often in use)
- Break-out rooms + additional campus (Science building) right next to the main venue. There are many classrooms available in this building of all different sizes. So, really as many break out rooms that we would need.
  - Would need to tell them what rooms we would need.
  - Mainly need to pin down the auditorium. If we have that pinned down, then it should be fine for the other rooms.

**Insurance cost per day**: ~1000E/day (250 auditorium + 50 per room). We don't have to pay for the rent of the venue, just the insurance. Everything else (projectors etc) are included.

The auditorium has been **preliminary booked** for Wed 30 May, Thu 31 May and Fri 1 June (last day until 13:00)


#### Catering

Please advise basic requirements and I can get quotes on your behalf.
  - 4-5 catering companies that usually work with the campus, all with different costs, so that would be a first thing to address
  - _Morning (on arrival)_: tea and coffee (maybe some cookies)?
  - _Mid Morning + Afternoon_: coffee / tea
  - _Lunch_: standing lunches, such as salads, sandwiches, etc. Sponsors are usually keen on sponsoring lunches.

There is the Science building restaurant exactly across from the auditorium building (student prices ~6-7E). There is also a canteen within walking distance. A lot of coffee shops within 2' walk from the building. Campus is largely empty at that time of the year.

If the lunch is good, we should aim for it. If something is sub-standard, we could completely omit it and let people mingle together for lunch on their own. Generally there are more than enough options for lunch - maybe aim for introducing the concept of "lunch buddies"?
  - _Welcome wagon_: people could be connected to each other.


#### Sponsors and Stalls

Chances are we are going to have sponsors, and they usually like to have stalls etc. Would it be possible to have something like that in the corridor outside the auditorium or close to where the catering would be.
Outside the auditorium there is a T-shape open space, where there can be a few stands and the catering.


#### Connectivity

There is both eduroam and open WiFi access.


#### Transportation

University is a little outside of town, but there's good transport.
 - There is public transport to and from the venue (city center to UCD is every 5').

A map of the conference venue and general location could be useful.


#### Accomodation


Block booking hotels around the campus, in order to make sure we have enough people.
  - 30 in 3 different hotels, also for hostels for undergrads/graduate students)

We could also have a look for **student residences** (they should be empty around that time)

Should be a lot of AirBnb in the area, because students are gone

University is a little outside of town, but there's good transport, so people could stay in town for ~25E a night in hostels for instance.

#### Sponsors

_Q_: What are the options for potential sponsors? Are there specific sponsors that usually work with UCD? Should this be something we will pursue independently?
- There is a huge number of tech companies in Dublin, but it is something to investigate.
  - Twitter is one of the companies that Normal can directly contact
- Other options include Google (located in Dublin), Amazon and Microsoft.


#### Other

Think about potential activities to propose.

After the official announcement, try to reach out the communities near Dublin/Ireland for volunteers to support Norman.

Ask for students to volunteer as local support/guides during the event.



#### Timeline for announcement

1. Norman confirms with UCD on Monday, October 30th. Also talk with outreach office in case they would prefer to announce first
2. We let the unsuccessful bids on Tuesday October 31st know and thank them for participation
3. We announce the formal venue and date of CarpentryCon 2018 on Wednesday November 1st.

### Action points:

- [ ] Belinda to draft a letter for sponsors.
- [ ] Have a map of the conference venue and general location.
- [ ] Block booking hotels around the campus, in order to make sure we have enough people. Aim for blocks of 30 in 3 different hotels, also for hostels for undergrads/graduate students
- [ ] Make a list of questions for Norman to ask Mary-Beth. She probably won't be too much involved, but probably Norman would be the direct contact point for the venue.
