### Discussion points:

1) __On Potential Venues__

* We need to make a decision about an open or targeted bid sooner rather than later (we need a decision by early-mid September)
* Question: Have we made our mind on an EU-based CarpentryCon, or are we open to a North America based one as well?
	* Yes, for the time being let's focus on EU.
* Looking at travel costs to EU, it makes more sense to aim for major airports (i.e Utrecht/Amsterdam) as opposed to San Sebastian/Bilbao or Heidelberg/Frankfurt.
* Have an open discussion at the next Community Call (August 17th) about venues.

2) __On the Agenda / Schedule__

Aim for an overarching theme:
* _CarpentryCon: Building Capacity_
* _CarpentryCon: Moving Globally, Building Locally_

Add in the CarpentryCon agenda activities such as:
* improv
* teaching practices
* how to efficiently hold meetings
* essentially anything that we learn as part of the community

The schedule should contain at least a single track with full agenda, and keep multiple concurrent sessions open (with the number of side sessions depending on the number of rooms available at venue)

For side activities we should include:
- BoFs / Interactive sessions / Technical topics (such as JupyterHub)
	* BoFs might be how to build a local study group/HackyHour
- Room for five minute/spontaneous talks (for sharing last minute great ideas) ?
- BYOL - Bring Your Own Lesson (Fotis idea)
	* Bring a lesson you're working on and turn it into a Carpentry style lesson
- How to create a lesson
- Some professional development type information - tutorial, hands-on, or lecture style


### Action points:

1. Create a google form for the Bid Template. Use as input the current information (from San Sebastian and Heidelberg sites) for "debugging" before opening up the form. *Make sure* to include a question regarding local staff (e.g. a local organizing committee)
2. Put information on the [potential sponsors list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JT7QHlHOirv0rRYcCGwRcDYuoJkBwrfaqqDvqJLxcSA/edit#gid=0)
3. Add comments on the three documents ([Topics and Themes](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/TopicsThemes.md), [Bid Template](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/BidTemplate.md) and [Draft Agenda](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/CarpentryConAgendaIdeas.md)  ) as issues in the Git Repo. Primary focus on adding extra activities (such as professional activites) in the agenda - examples of how people are building their local communities.
4. Migrate minutes from the [TF repo](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/TaskForces/2018-CarpentryCon) to the CarpentryCon repo, and amend the TF README file to point to the new repo.
