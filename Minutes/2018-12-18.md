### Discussion points (_Call #1)_:

#### Introduction:

  - Anne Fouilloux: University of Oslo.
  - Silvia di Giorgio: PhD Student in bioinformatics, Un. Koln.
  - Jessica Upani. I'm from the University of Namibia. I attended the first CarpentryCon this year. I would like to help and contribute in any way.

  - Gabriel: Postdoc university South Africa. Attended CarpentryConnect Johannesburg.
  - Ouso Dan: Observing, currently on the checkout process as an Instructor. Located at Nairobi Kenya.

#### CarpentryCon TaskForce Timeline

- Based on the last CC we compiled a document of our work and timeline, that should help in navigating the new members
- We started by self-organizing, as chairs we took of organizing the meeting and making sure that the entire team is informed of everything we do
- we divided the tasks into smaller ones, for. e.g.: looking for a venue, creating rubrics of what we wanted to see in a venue, agreeing collectively on which venue to take for the meeting (Dublin)
- There are few idea that we have received from the community (participant driven, more activities for interaction) including the format that we want to keep (skill up, keynotes, break-out)
- Every task took time, therefore its important to decide the priorities (venue, keynote) then pursue other tasks such as identifying different sessions, seeking chairs
- after the first one, we will find it easier to get ideas from the communities and sessions run in parallel
- after the venue, we need sponsorship which also requires time to allow defining the budget (we didn't have that for the last one)
- Local community: find a local host, and get a few more people involved (volunteers are needed closer in time)
- We need to do most of the tasks earlier

#### Overall Debriefing

- at the end of the document added tasks by planning phase (should help in picking the areas of work that the taskForce members are interested in). GDoc available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sm1saUP6gtSkBrhTBE_8LKmK_PMaEmp_UUkx9WOW4oA/edit#heading=h.rgoeqrnkpr3q) This document is for our internal use. Add your email address, and we'll share the document with you.
- The document is written as the time of priority: Theme -> website -> sponsorship + speaker -> ...
- It will help you pick the task that you like and would like to contribute
- It doesn't matter how much time you can commit, but we would need consistency
- we get a lt of support from teh staff - > admin, sponsorships, finances

- More interaction closer to time
  - In the beginning we had 2 calls a day (repeated, second one was review)
  - closer to time we had single calls to make it productive

#### Q&A
- Anne: when will be the kick-off meeting?
  - Beginning of January
  - Sign your name at the end of Call #1 notes so we can add you to the mailiing list

- What kind of participation works meetings vs behind the scenes?
  - being on the call was easier in terms of being informed and actually feel like a part of a team
  - you will have independence for the work you do, so its good to come to the call and update
  - you can obviously skip some meetings, but it is a team building exercise

- the links on the top are not working: update them with the working links

### Discussion points (_Call #2)_:

#### Recap of past taskforce (for Carpentry Con 2018): tasks, timeline, etc.

**Timeline**

- Self-organize, set up the structure of the group
  - Regular meetings (every 3-4 weeks)
  - Malvika + Fotis were co-chairs, led calls, kept minutes, keeping up with people working on tasks
  - Members had different tasks that they would work on between meetings
- Venue
  - Put together a form soliciting locations, reviewed as a TF
  - Shared form with networks
  - Review inputs, get more community feedback on choice of venue (accessibility, etc.)
  - Then find out availability + connect w/ venue --> important to have someone on the TF who is AT that location and can be a local contact
- Agenda/Program
  - TF discussions, then ask for community feedback (how long, what types of sessions)
  - As soon as structure is set, need to get keynotes
  - What is the goal of Carpentry Con?
    - Some things will stay the same (skill-ups, how to get people to talk to each other, etc.)
    - The exact direction of Carpentry Con 2020 may be different!
  - Then solicit interest in topics + leading sessions
    - Hopefully more interest in leading sessions this time around.  
- Money
  - Ongoing through the process
  - Reaching out to sponsors
  - Significant percentage of Carpentry Con funding was through sponsors, not registrations
- Location stuff
  - Hotels
  - Restaurants
  - Things to do
  - Etc.
- SWAG. :DDD
- Finalizing stuff like:
  - Volunteers
  - Content of sessions
  - A/V requirements
  - etc.

**General notes**

* notice that there's a lot of community feedback cycles, soliciting help from community.  
* certain things had to be learned for the first time for Carpentry Con 2018 and these have been documented.
* a timeline was produced from the debrief and can guide the process this time

**Time commitment**
- doesn't have to be a huge amount of time, but a *regular* committment (per week) is really helpful
- commit from now until Carpentry Con 2020 happens
- chairs tried to attend both meetings at the start, ended up doing a combined meeting towards the end
- calls started out monthly, but were weekly at the end

_**Checking emails was really important**!  Being in contact w/ people and staying in communication, asking for help._

#### Q & A

- What's the ideal task force size?
  - Out of a larger group, had a core of 8-10 (including Sher + Belinda)
  - Hope to have 10-12 for the task force this time -- more hands to split task
- From morning: how do you split tasks amongst the group?
  - Kickoff call in January
  - Group's decision on how to self-organize (note-keepers + drivers)
  - Good idea to have a point person responsible for major areas (like program, keynotes, etc.)
    - can then have small teams who aren't able to commit to the whole TF, but can help in particular areas
- Does the debrief contain feedback from the conference?
  - Mostly on the organizational aspect
  - There *is* feedback incorporated into the debrief
- Where does budget fit into the timeline?
  - as soon as you have the venue, need to work on both budget (comes along w/ looking for sponsors) + agenda
  - note from Mark: included priorities (like how expensive you're willing to be) + worked backwards
- How to get feedback from community?
  - Leverage Carpentries staff
  - Lots of visibilities (tweets + blogs)
  - Fotis is optimistic about getting more feedback this time, because Carpentry Con means something, and is not some vague idea. :)
- Any requirements to get involved?
  - Just be an instructor
  - Really want it to be a participants workshop, not the taskforce workshop
