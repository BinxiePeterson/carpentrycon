# About
This workflow was developed to help session chairs remember what to do when facilitating their session.

# Before the session

- Make sure that you are aware of the room numbers. You will get the information on [this directory](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/tree/master/program), or by directly contacting the organizers at the conference.
- You are expected to bring any material such as handouts, required for the session. In case you need any additional material for your session, please get in touch with the Carpentries Taskforce by emailing carpentrycon@carpentries.org.
- Each session lead will be accompanied by 1-2 volunteers who will offer their help in setting up the room and take notes to summarize the session.
- Please check [this repository](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/tree/master/Sessions) to make sure that it has a directory for your session. You can add all the materials used in your session and the session summary to the right directory.
- If you have not added an abstract for your session yet, please do so. Also, don't forget to add a short bio and picture [here](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/tree/master/ShortBio/SessionChairs). We will link this information to the program to attract the right audience to your session.
