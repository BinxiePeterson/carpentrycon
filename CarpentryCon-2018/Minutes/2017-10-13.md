  - Venue is big, but not sure if we can get a big crown there
  - The airport is not centrally located
  - The local community is not big enough, but there are new start ups
- Downside of Heidelberg
  - Smaller local community
  - The airport is centrally located but the city itself is a bit small
  - Venue of BioQuant is very small

Ultimately selected venue: **DUBLIN**.
