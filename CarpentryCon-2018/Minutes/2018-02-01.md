_see Action Point #1 / #2_

#### **Point #2**: _Agenda topics from community - final schedule_

- Schedule on the website have been agreed upon
- Contact UCD with regards on the evening of the day before;
  - if we have the venue, all ok
  - if not, we move the plan to somewhere off-campus
    - Can be organized with the volunteers (Sher has spoken to Ivo, a volunteer from UCD <- he's here at MUN :) )
- We could plan to get the registration picked from the hotel reception
- Welcome event the night before, at the venue (if available), and then move on from there
  - Fotis will email Fiona about the availability of UCD venue a day before

- Original: option for participants to come up with workshops of their choice (make a pitch on day II), but there isn't currently a space for that workshop in the schedule
  - option 1: leave schedule as is, and designate rooms and time slots for good ideas as they happen as an option
  + **option 2**: keep open workshop on last day (drop the fund-raising workshop #3)

- _Do we want to start populating the facilitators of the breakouts? workshops?  As we firm up the schedule?_
  - [Google sheet for in-progress program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G80RPvP8DMPZ89i2vfStdT_6ComP4qsI8ioEvUep2Vw/edit?usp=sharing), available as PDF to participants.
  - Once the program is fixed, Belinda and Sher will plan who from the taskforce will contact the person who suggested the topic

- _What is the timeline for choosing lightning talks? (Thinking in terms of applying for funding again; helpful to know if you are giving a talk when applying)_
  - We have 17 responses, we can limit 3-4 lightening talks per session
  - We can have a few empty slots for open-mic kind of talk
  - There should be a few slots for the report of breakout
    - This could be done before dinner/reception
  - Belinda will divide the talks into different sessions and contact the volunteers who suggested the talk

- Call for abstracts for papers and posters should be announced
  - A google form similar to EasyChair can be used for this: Fotis
