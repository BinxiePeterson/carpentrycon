### Update regarding Actions
- Community Call in August had a very positive feedback on Carpentry Con. Major points:
  1. facilitate visa first and second time travelling and third $ (_rsilva_)
  2. Select venue first, then focus on the main track / duration and finally populate BoFs
  3. General timeline: Select venue by October, finish major organizational aspects by December 2017 / January 2018, and have the final 3-4 months for ironing out details

- We already have two venues submitted (see [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rJkCU_04s84l3187DoHWe-qewUjbDIi558YXawHp3DI/edit?usp=drive_web) ).

- Malvika has been in contact with two locations:
    1. In Heidelberg: may be rather expensive, but she'll put the bid in in any case (_BioQuant_). Some financial support will be offered by de.NBI.
    2. Dublin; several contacts there (_UCD_)
      - In contact with: Norman Davey, an Asst. Prof in UCD and a fellow of http://www.sfi.ie/, he is eligible to apply for financial support (10-50k Euros) for the conference.
      - There is a local organization / bureau supporting (and partially funding) such events (link [here](http://www.dublinconventionbureau.com/Let_Us_Help/DCB-services) ).
      - More contacts were received via twitter, we are in touch with them.

### Discussion points (_Call #1)_:

The venue bid will help us better rank and choose the potential venues, so if there are any current bids, feel free to add them directly.
- Mateusz will input additional venues by the end of the month: San Sebastian and Amsterdam (if possible)

Monitor the discussions on the Discuss list for potential ideas for BoF / Break-out sessions.



### Discussion points (_Call #2)_:

Malvika will submit the complete bids for the two venues by 25th September.

As soon as we have finalized a venue, we will have a list of actions (and assignees) for the next steps.


#### Expected Timeline

Timeline aiming for mid-May - mid June as this is the most convenient period for attracting more participants.
1. Deadline for submitting new venues: **Friday, September 29th 2017**
2. Review and select top two candidates (or single choice) in the first week of October (02 - 06 / 10 /2017)
  - The next CarpentryCon call (Thursday, October 5th) will focus on ranking the submitted venues.
3. If we don't have a signed contract on venue by **December 31st 2017, the event should be cancelled**
4. Venue and Sponsors should be dealt with within September, October and November


### Action points:
1. In the next weeks send out another reminder of the call for venues (11-12/09 and 25-26/09)
2. Absolute deadline for submitting venue Friday 29/09
3. We have a week to review (02-06/10) and reach a final decision
4. Have a second Community Call on CarprentryCon near the actual event, focusing on the BoFs (ideas and who is willing to lead the sessions)
5. Start a list of potential keynotes/plenaries for CarpentryCon
