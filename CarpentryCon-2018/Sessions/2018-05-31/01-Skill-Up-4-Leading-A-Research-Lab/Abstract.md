## Lead(s)

## Abstract

As your career in research advances, you will naturally begin taking on additional responsibility in designing, implementing, and completing research projects. If you are aiming to run your own research lab, you will need to consider how to manage multiple research projects with corresponding teams of people. While you may have considered developing a medium to long term plan for specific research activities, successfully leading a research lab also involves administrative and managerial skills -- but such techniques are rarely taught to researchers. 

This skill-up is aimed at students and postdocs, but early career researchers and seasoned research veterans are also welcome to share experiences. We will address the following general questions:

- What does leading a research lab entail, and how do you design a strategy appropriate for your research interests? 
- What skills are necessary to lead a research team, and how can you obtain those skills?
