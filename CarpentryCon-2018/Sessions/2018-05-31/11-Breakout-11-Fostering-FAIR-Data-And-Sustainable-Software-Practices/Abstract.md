# Breakout 11: **Fostering FAIR Data and Sustainable Software Practices**

## Lead(s)

Bérénice Batut & Katrin Leinweber

## Abstract

How can we apply the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to the different scientific objects? These objects can be datasets, source code of software or scripts, publications, training materials, etc. In this breakout session we'll introduce the principles and want to discuss with you which best practices and tools fit each purpose. Which differences and commonalities can we observe?
