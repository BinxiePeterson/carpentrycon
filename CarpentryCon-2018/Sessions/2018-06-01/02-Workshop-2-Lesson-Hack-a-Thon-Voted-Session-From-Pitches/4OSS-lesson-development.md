## Lead(s)
Allegra Via, Paula Martinez, Fotis Psomopoulos, Mateusz Kuzak

## Abstract
ELIXIR Training Platform lesson development hackathon for teaching best practices in research software development is
based on four simple recommendations [1] (4OSS). We are adopting the Carpentries approach and policy for training material
development and maintenance to help us in providing clear guidelines on how to implement the 4OSS recommendations.
This brainstorming workshop will be the initiation step to define content for the hackathon in August. The overall aim is
that these 4OSS in the shape of training materials will contribute to make software FAIR.

We invite the attendees of CarpentryCon who are familiar with lesson development, or want to support and contribute with
this ELIXIR initiative. In this workshop we want to collaboratively develop the content for the hackathon which will be
developed by the community and shared via GitHub. This approach has proven to be very successful, allowing for maximum
inclusivity and production of high quality training materials avoiding redundancy in contents [1][2][3].
