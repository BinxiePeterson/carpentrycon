## Lead(s)

## Abstract

The [Ally Skills Workshop](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/) teaches simple everyday ways for people to use their privilege and influence to support people who are targets of systemic oppression in their workplaces and communities. This includes women of all races, people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ folks, parents, caregivers of all sorts, and people of different ages. The workshop starts with a 30 minute introduction followed by about 2.5 hours of small group discussion with a short wrap-up. After being presented with a real-world scenario in which an ally could take action, each group discusses what actions to take, followed by a group report-out and discussion led by the facilitator. We will discuss 6-8 scenarios. Participants learn ally skills by practicing them during the discussion: listening, amplifying voices, identifying patterns, and more.

After this workshop, you should be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:

* Were the skills taught in this workshop useful in your workplace or community?
* Were most of the scenarios discussed relevant to your workplace or community?
* Do you feel more confident about how or when to respond when you encounter bias in your daily life?
