## Abstract
The purpose of the RDA Early Career and Engagement Interest Group (ECEIG) is to provide a focal point for Early and Mid-Career Researchers and Professionals, including those involved in various RDA-related fellowships and Early Career programs. RDA members recognized that there is a need to create a space in RDA for those who are at the beginning stages of their careers. Specifically, RDA members recognized that Early Career Researchers and Professionals usually need additional support for: (a) networking amongst themselves to learn about other Early Career scientists and their research, i.e., establishing a network of peers, and (b) mentoring from senior RDA members who are interested in mentoring Early Career Researchers and Professionals. This lightning talk will give a brief overview of the community building done within RDA, using The Carpentries approach as the driving template.
