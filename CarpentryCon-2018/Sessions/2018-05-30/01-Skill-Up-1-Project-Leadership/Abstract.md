## Abstract
Project leadership is an area growing in relevance and importance as projects are being delivered in a more complex and uncertain environmentâ€” one which, many would argue, requires more leadership. Much of what we know about what makes up the leadership of effective project managers, including the skills and competencies that contribute to it, takes the form of lists of important project manager skills and competencies. These lists can make use of grouping or sorting (into technical, business and social skills, for example) and some are very complete. However, while the lists are useful in that they provide a starting point, they are also static and do not reflect the particular elements of the dynamic between project manager and project. This interactive session will discuss some best practices, ideas and concepts for leading projects effectively. This will be a collaborative session - the floor will be open so we can all share good ideas.
