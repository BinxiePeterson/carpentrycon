## Abstract
ELIXIR is a European research infrastructure with a mission to manage and safeguard the increasing volume of data generated by life science research. ELIXIR's activities are structured into five areas called 'Platforms'. These are: Data, Tools, Interoperability, Compute and Training. The ELIXIR training platform (TP) provides training to researchers, developers and trainers in topics identified as gaps within the ELIXIR community including how big data is generated, analysed and interpreted. The ELIXIR TP collaborates with international organisations, such as GOBLET, BD2K, EU Projects and The Carpentries. Following the experience gained from the ELIXIR Software and Data Carpentry pilot action project^1^ through 2015-2016, a new Carpentries-ELIXIR programme has been agreed in 2018. The aim of this agreement is to teach basic computational skills to life science researchers by running Software and Data Carpentry workshops in ELIXIR nodes, and increase the number of instructors within ELIXIR with dedicated Instructor Training workshops.
