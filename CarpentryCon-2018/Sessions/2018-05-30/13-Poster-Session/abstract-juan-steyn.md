## Abstract
Researchers, students, and librarians are increasingly starting to engage in projects with more complex computing components in order to harness the power of larger and often open datasets and technology. They often find themselves in unknown territory without a clear idea of a good starting point for acquiring new skills or finding potential collaborators. To help address this challenge within the domain of the Humanities and Social Sciences, the South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR), a new national infrastructure, collaborated with fellow Carpentry instructors in South Africa to make a series of Data Carpentry workshops possible. This talk/poster reports on lessons learned, the value of institutional collaboration in building sustainable communities and it reflects on the "Carpentry approach" used in mixed environments, especially when introducing RDM concepts. This talk may serve as a model/case study for other similar capacity development initiatives elsewhere.
