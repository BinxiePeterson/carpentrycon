## Abstract
The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) is a diverse and modern research institute, hosting ~600 life scientists. Reflecting a general trend in biological research, the fraction of EMBL scientists devoting 50% of their time to computational activity grew from 39% to 46% between 2009 and 2015. These computational scientists are distributed among >50 research groups, with great variety in the approaches they use. This large and varied environment presents challenges for effective and efficient computational science. Bio-IT is an initiative established to support the development and technical capability of this diverse computational biology community. The community has grown organically to tackle challenges together, providing training and support for scientific computing, creating and maintaining tools and resources for reproducible science, and providing opportunities for discussion and collaboration. Highlights include an internal system for version control and management of software development projects, a coding club, and training courses for >600 people since 2015. Here, we share some lessons learned while establishing this community, and discuss current efforts to connect and share experience and resources with other scientific communities.
