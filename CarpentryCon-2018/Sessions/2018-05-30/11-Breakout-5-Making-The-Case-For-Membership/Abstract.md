## Abstract

A membership with The Carpentries can help your organization to build local capacity to run Carpentry workshops at 
your organization. Memberships provide your organization with many benefits, including regular annual instructor training. Being a member will also connect you with an international community of organizations working to develop their own skills communities. Through collective effort, The Carpentries community globally is working to grow and interconnect peer-driven learning communities to develop the next generation of data driven scholars.  In this session we will share, and talk about tips and tricks for making the case for membership at your organization. Organizations are all different, but we will talk through some ways in which Carpentries membership can be presented to your local decision makers. With a small investment from your organization in The Carpentries, we can help you have a huge impact at your organization. In this session we'll start with some common techniques, but save some time to let participants share their own challenges and experiences.
