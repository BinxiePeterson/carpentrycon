## Abstract
The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is an annual, three-day community and skill building event for graduate students and early career researchers. The first event was run in Melbourne in 2015, but the model has since spread to other countries - the US, Ecuador, Canada, New Zealand and Norway among others. There were 16 ResBazzes worldwide in 2017. The model is very flexible and adaptable and provides a way for Carpentries instructors to join forces with other people teaching digital research skills.
