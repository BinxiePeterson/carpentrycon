### Use and Adaptation of Carpentry Lessons in RDM Training at an Academic Library

* Got involved in Carpentries w/Erika Mias, went to 1st Library Carpentry in South Africa workshop together
* Saw the value of LC in the library where she worked
* Was tasked with implementing research data services at University of Capetown
* Challenge with motivating librarians, saw value of Carpentries to work with librarians to support research data services
* Borrowed from Library Carpentry.  Used structure of lessons, replace content with their own data
* Borrowed sticky note concept for session feedback
* Distributed survey to all participants. Developed their own survey. Published data locallly and at South African library conference
* Found confidence increased some, but not dramatically
* Started organizing informal Library Carpentry workshops, moved from informal to formal lessons
* Joined Carpentry instructor training and mentoring programming
* Joined African task force
* Now uses Carpentries methods in all parts of her work - eg figshare training and demos
* Carpentries ethos is part of how she approaches everything

### Load Magic for More Fluid Activities 

* Load magic is a feature in Jupyter notebooks
* Looked for ways to get content into notebook to get controlled data set or files  and environment
* `%load path/to/file`
* Run cell and the file contents (text) load into the cell
* Magic line is automatically commented out
* Can easily get content in, no switching tabs or windows, no copy/paste
* Put all her content on github, which can be downloaded as zip file.  This allows changes to be made continually.  Students can then download and use the zip file without needing to know how to use github.
* Benefits:
  * Fewer syntax error 
  * Didn’t have to switch tabs/windows to copy/paste
  * Focus could be on completing exercises
  * Can make prep and management of workshops easier (see poster session for more info)

### R at Sea: A Carpentry Inspired Workshop for Immersive Learning On and Under the Water

* At Field School in Miami FL: provides field training for marine biologist students. Aim is to provide research skills to help enhance current positions or help get future positions.  Mostly shark and ray biologists.
* Research skills are not limited to field schools.  Saw obvious gap in the curriculum.  Once this data has been collected, no one knows what to do with it.
* Proposed “R at Sea” course to emphasize importance of coding skills.  Learners rotate between coding and immersive adventure (diving and exploring sea).
* Course was based on effective teaching practices from the Carpentries.
* Green Lessons Learned:
  * Non traditional learning spaces work
  * Pair programming works  
  * Sticky notes are important
  * Fill in the blank coding templates helped overcome cognitive load
  * Casual evening sessions work for applying what they have learned
* Red Lessons Learned:
  * Need to be good at defining modeling expectations
  * Need to have more time for evening coworking sessions
  * Internet is a luxury on a boat!  Have all the things on flashdrives
  * Sun drains energy
  * Bring sea sickness medicine

### Community Driven Training for Biological Data Analysis with the Galaxy Training Network
training.galaxyproject.org

* Analyzed need and demand for bioinformatic training.  Bioinformatics is getting too central to biologists to be left to specialists
* Galaxy: A web framework for bioinformatics tools, so no need for individual computer configuration
* Website has 80+ tutorials on various topics
* Tutorials are built around a “research story”
* Worked on building training infrastructure with interactive platforms, up to date on best practices, covering as many bioinformatics topics as possible
* Can be used by individual users as well as for full workshops
* FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and Open
* Includes tech support 
* Community driven content - online platform and community events to network
* More info in tonight’s poster session
