## Abstract
Over the past 2 years I have been a stakeholder in the implementation of research data services at UCT Libraries. Once tools and services were put in place, it was quite clear that librarians were not ready, or confident on matters of RDM, and were in need of training to increase their knowledge of RDM and boost confidence around using computational tools for RDM. We reused and adapted the Library Carpentry lessons (in particular, Intro to data and OpenRefine) to suite our local context and create a guilt-free environment for librarians to talk about issues of RDM and begin to learn how best to support these new research practices. This lightning talk will show how and why we adapted the lessons, and feedback on the success of using carpentry lessons to support staff development, outside of a carpentry workshop.
