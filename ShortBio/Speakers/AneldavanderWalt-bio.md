**Short bio**

[Anelda van der Walt](https://twitter.com/aneldavdw) works with various organisations to improve computational and digital literacy and the establishment of communities of practice amongst African researchers, students, and support staff. The infectious vibe of collaboration and community experienced at her first Carpentry workshop in 2014 in Cape Town, made her realise there was a massive need for more such events locally. She founded [Talarify](http://www.talarify.co.za/) in order to help drive change through sharing knowledge and is doing this by creating awareness of, and improving access to, reusable online materials, open communities, and free and/or open source tools. She was voted the [2017 Carpentries Community Service Award winner](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/csa-award-avdw/).
