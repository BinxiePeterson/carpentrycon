I am a bioinformatician at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany.
In this role, I help to coordinate a community building and support project, Bio-IT, for computational
biologists at EMBL. Amongst other things, this involves organising and teaching a lot of courses, 
including Software and Data Carpentry workshops. After becoming an instructor in 2016, I have been
inspired by the kindness and positivity that pervades the Carpentries community and try to contribute
to this through involvement in the Mentoring Subcommittee and our instructor discussion sessions.
I am an enthusiatic and limited cyclist, and a fan of punk rock bands that I think everyone should
love but that, strangely, no-one seems to have heard of.
