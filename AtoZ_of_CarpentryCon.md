## A to Z of CarpentryCon

Below you will find all the information that we thought might help you plan your trip to Dublin for CarpentryCon 2018. We took this challenge at one of our several meetings to find all the keywords starting A-Z to address any query you might have about the conference. We are pretty confident that the following list covers everything, but reach out to us and let us know if something is missing. Please take a look at this so that you can plan your stay in Dublin ahead of time and have the best time during the conference. We are very excited to meet you at CarpentryCon 2018!

#### A: Arrival, Access, Accommodation, Allies

##### Arrival and Access

You can exchange your registration ticket for a name tag, badges and lunch tickets. The registration desk will be located at the conference site starting from Tuesday evening (the night before the conference).

The corresponding accommodation provider will provide you with all the required information. Several of these sites are wheelchair accessible. You must make sure that you have made arrangements for your accommodation in one of these (or other) hotels.

##### Allies

An ally is someone who uses her/his/their societal privileges for supporting members of other identity groups. We would like to create an inclusive environment at CarpentryCon and invite you to extend your support to others at this conference and beyond. You can learn through [resources](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/#materials) made available by one of our Keynote speakers [Valerie Aurora](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/ShortBio/Speakers/ValerieAurora-bio.md). Additionally, Valerie will offer the [Ally workshop](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/tree/master/Sessions/2018-06-01/03-Workshop-3-Ally-Workshop-With-Valerie-Aurora) on June 1 in parallel to other workshops.

#### B: Badges, Break-out sessions, Bars

##### Badges

#### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

##### Icebreaker

Many people coming to CarpentryCon 2018 will be new to our community. We know that coming into any big event for the first time can be a little intimidating. You may not know anyone but it seems like everyone else knows lots of people. We want to make sure that everyone who comes to CarpentryCon 2018 feels a sense of belonging right from the start. As the first activity at CarpentryCon, we (led by Belinda Weaver) have planned an icebreaker event for everyone to connect with a small group of people to swap stories about why they are here. See [here](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/Sessions/2018-05-30/00-Icebreaker-Story-Circles.md) for detail.

##### Weather

The temperature during the conference, as per the accuweather-forecast, will be 8-16 Degree Celcius. Weather in Dublin changes a lot through the day. It is not unusual to have wind, short rain showers, and surprising sunshine, all in one day. Unfortunately, the city is also extremely windy so umbrellas will not be very useful! A good strategy is to resort to layered clothing and to bring waterproof shoes and jackets.
