## A to Z of CarpentryCon (Under preparation...)

Below you will find all the information that we thought might help you plan your trip to Dublin for CarpentryCon 2018. We took this challenge at one of our several meetings to find all the keywords starting A-Z to address any query you might have about the conference. We are pretty confident that the following list covers everything, but reach out to us and let us know if something is missing. Please take a look at this so that you can plan your stay in Dublin ahead of time and have the best time during the conference. We are very excited to meet you at CarpentryCon 2018!

#### A: Arrival, Access, Accommodation, Allies

You must make sure that you have made arrangements for your accommodation in one of these (or other) hotels.

##### Allies

An ally is someone who uses her/his/their societal privileges for supporting members of other identity groups. We would like to create an inclusive environment at CarpentryCon and invite you to extend your support to others at this conference and beyond. You can learn through [resources](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/#materials) made available by one of our Keynote speakers [Valerie Aurora](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/ShortBio/Speakers/ValerieAurora-bio.md). Additionally, Valerie will offer the [Ally workshop](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/tree/master/Sessions/2018-06-01/03-Workshop-3-Ally-Workshop-With-Valerie-Aurora) on June 1 in parallel to other workshops.

#### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

##### Icebreaker

Many people coming to CarpentryCon 2018 will be new to our community. We know that coming into any big event for the first time can be a little intimidating. You may not know anyone but it seems like everyone else knows lots of people. We want to make sure that everyone who comes to CarpentryCon 2018 feels a sense of belonging right from the start. As the first activity at CarpentryCon, we (led by Belinda Weaver) have planned an icebreaker event for everyone to connect with a small group of people to swap stories about why they are here. See [here](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/Sessions/2018-05-30/00-Icebreaker-Story-Circles.md) for detail.

##### Inclusion

We want to create an inclusive and welcoming environment at the conference. We are providing travel assistance to facilitate attendance from as wide a group as possible. We are collecting full details to identify needs for childcare and mobility, accessibility and dietary preferences during registeration. Feel free to reach out to the organizers and staff if they can improve your participation at CarpentryCon. (see *Allies, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Emergency*)

#### J: Job Board, Join the Carpentries

##### Job Board (Job Seekers & Job Providers)

See [here](https://carpentries.org/join/) for more detail.

#### K: Keynote Speakers, Knowledge sharing

##### Keynote Speakers

We have fantastic keynote speakers lined up for you at CarpentryCon. Our 4 speakers are: **Valerie Aurora** (founder of FrameShift consulting for diversity & inclusion in tech), **Desmond Higgins** (professor of bioinformatics in UCD, and recipient of 2018 Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Access in the life sciences), **Anelda van der Walt** (founder of Talarify, and recipient of 2017 Carpentries Community Service Award for her work in South Africa), **Greg Wilson** (co-founder Software Carpentry. Head of Instructor Training for DataCamp). We are very excited to have these leaders from their field at CarpentryCon and looking forward to their talks. See the [official website](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#comp) for more detail.

##### Knowledge sharing

We, as organizers, have put a lot of efforts in making sure that you get several opportunities to learn new skills and ideas while expanding your network. In this 3-day high-intensive conference you will learn from: (1) the experts through keynote talks, skill-up session, and workshops, (2) share your ideas with each other in discussion/breakout sessions and get tips from the session leads and other attendees, (3) suggest, vote and lead a session on spot and share your own best practices and challenges. At the conference, you will be surrounded by the community leaders, trainers and everyone who is seeking to learn. We can assure you that you will get much more than 'just another conference experience' if you reach out to your neighbor during coffee breaks, at the watercoolers, while sharing charging stations, at lunches, in the breakout rooms, and at conference receptions.

##### Weather

The temperature during the conference, as per the accuweather-forecast, will be 8-16 Degree Celcius. Weather in Dublin changes a lot through the day. It is not unusual to have wind, short rain showers, and surprising sunshine, all in one day. Unfortunately, the city is also extremely windy so umbrellas will not be very useful! A good strategy is to resort to layered clothing and to bring waterproof shoes and jackets.

##### Workshops

On June 1, the last of conference, we will run several parallel workshop sessions. There will be a limited number of seats available for each of this workshop and you will receive an email from us stating how you can secure a place in the workshop of your choice. We are still discussing to offer some seats for the partcipants from UCD, who would be able to register on spot with a minimum fee.

##### Wireless

Two wireless networks are available in the UCD O'Brien Centre for Science:

|UCD Wireless|Eduroam (requires access via your home institution)|
|--|--|
|<table> <tr><td>**SSID**</td><td>UCD Wireless</td></tr> <tr><td>**Network type**</td><td>Access point</td></tr> <tr><td>**Security type**</td><td>No authentication</td></tr> <tr><td>**Encryption type**</td><td>None</td></tr></table>| <table> <tr><td>**SSID**</td><td>eduroam</td></tr> <tr><td>**Network type**</td><td>Access point</td></tr> <tr><td>**Security type**</td><td>WPA2-Enterprise</td></tr> <tr><td>**Encryption type**</td><td>AES</td></tr></table>|

##### Welcome-Team

The group of volunteers and organisers will be the part of this welcome group who will guide you and will be there to offer you any sort of assistance from the beginning to the end of the conference. Make yourself familiarised with them (name tag, T-shirt etc.).

##### Wish board

At the conference site, we will put a wish-board for you where you can add your 'wish' for CarpentryCon, The Carpentries and its community. We will let you decide what this means to you! :)

##### Watercoolers

Watercoolers will be available in several spots of the conference venue. Try to minimise the waste by avoiding to get more packaged water bottles and re-using your cups.

We will maintain the same ethics at CarpentryCon and would request all our participants to familiarize themselves with our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

***Discrimination in any form including behavious or remarks against any nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, religious and cultural belief will not be tolerated!*** (also see *Allies, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Inclusion*)

#### Y: You!

[Who Belongs at CarpentryCon 2018? You do.](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/03/who-belongs-carpentrycon/) (- Blog by Belinda)

This event is for **you**. The success of this conference will be measured by what you gain at the conference and afterwards in terms of skills, knowledge and networking.

Be mindful that the organizers are also volunteers who are organizing this for the community by working beyond their work. Therefore, we invite you to step in if you see that something at the conference is not working and you have the idea and capacity to *fix* it for others.
