## A to Z of CarpentryCon

Below you will find all the information that we thought might help you plan your trip to Dublin for CarpentryCon 2018. We took this challenge at one of our several meetings to find all the keywords starting A-Z to cover all the queries you might have about the conference. We are pretty confident that we have been able to do that, (except that we cheated for the letter X and Z and will be happy to give a special goodie to anyone who has a better idea!), but please don’t hesitate to reach out to us and let us know if something is missing. Please take a look at this so that you can plan your stay in Dublin ahead of time and have the best time during the conference. We are very excited to meet you at CarpentryCon 2018!

Many people coming to CarpentryCon 2018 will be new to our community. We know that coming into any big event for the first time can be a little intimidating. You may not know anyone but it seems like everyone else knows lots of people. We want to make sure that everyone who comes to CarpentryCon 2018 feels a sense of belonging right from the start. As the first activity at CarpentryCon, we (led by Belinda Weaver) have planned an icebreaker event for everyone to connect with a small group of people to swap stories about why they are here. See [here](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/Sessions/2018-05-30/00-Icebreaker-Story-Circles.md) for detail.
