# Schedule Brainstorm

Questions to answer and Issues to Keep in Mind

* Participant activities to present
  * Needed to justify travel
  * Just good to see what others are doing
  * Vendors/sponsors like having posters sessions around booths
    * Poster session (poster session at the end of the day so the attendees can socialize as well)
    * Lightning talks
        * 3 in 3 (three slides in three minutes)
        * When there are more posters, we can even do 1 minute (1 slide) lightening talk
    * Speakers’ Corner (dedicated time/place for 5’ elevator pitch by any participant/sponsor/vendor)
    * Other?
      * Birds of a feather (BoF) on the participant suggested topics, this can run as a parallel session
* Banquet
  * Sit-down or buffet?
    * We can look for the sit-down option, but ask participants to pay for this separately so they can decide to come along of skip
    * Buffet can be MUCH more economical    
  * Speaker or not
    * A community related talk will be quite motivating and will help in getting the conversation for the rest of the going
    * I was thinking maybe Greg Wilson here

## Other conferences for reference

**[OpenCon 2016](http://www.opencon2017.org/opencon_2016_highlights)**

[Schedule](https://opencon2016.sched.com/)

Good combination of keynotes, talks, workshops, unconference sessions, webcasts and satellite hosts
Midwest Data Librarian Symposium

**Unconference Conference**

[Schedule 2016](https://mwdatalibrariansymposium.wordpress.com/symposium-schedule/)

[Schedule 2015](https://mwdatalibrariansymposium.wordpress.com/past-conferences/)

This focused on the activities which are participant based  with facilitators for each workshop session.

**RDAP**

[Schedule](https://www.asis.org/rdap/program-2017/)

I liked their use and makeup of panels with the idea of an open discussion with attendees. Secondarily, the workshop idea for rubrics for DMPs, where for the Carpentries the issue is assessment.

**Unidata Triennial Workshops**

[Schedule](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/events/#triennial)

Pick a workshop. Mix of hands on and speakers. This is where I got the idea of a theme a day.

**csv.conf**

Also check out csv.conf which was a really great conference with a great vibe and lots of fun/engagement.
