## Gen updates
- Meeting times (earlier shared via Slack):
	- To accomodate all and be considerate of time zones, proposing that we have two time periods that alternate from week to week:
       > **Tue at 1700 UTC (as it was this week - today)**
       > **Tue at 1400 UTC (as it will be in the next TF meeting, next week)**
	- **Question:** Are we doing both times each week or one time which switches each week?  - one time which switches each week
	- Attend the one you can, but not compulsory to attend both
	- Also changing to have a weekly meeting, but appreciating that not everyone can make it to each meeting
	- **This is a pilot** - testing to see if it will work better.
	- Voluntary co-working hours for CarpentryCon work: idea to put time on calendars that is available to all on TF, to be accountable to working together (no strings)
		- Could be shared Zoom room, or just on Slack
		- Christina and Elizabeth are trying this on Wed/14th at 4pm Pacific - join if you can!
	- Request for someone to make recurring Google invites - Sher sent out two event invites, she can update email list
